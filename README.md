WHAT:
My attempt at the Substring project from The Odin Project found here:
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks#project-3-substrings

FEEDBACK:
is encouraged and can be sent to: https://twitter.com/loudmouse312

INSTRUCTIONS:
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument
and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument.
It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string
and how many times it was found. Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words.

AFTERTHOUGHTS:
what is a real world problem a program like this could help solve?
